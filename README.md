## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for device/emulator)
- Supabase project (URL + anon/public key)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwapnilChand0623/Campus-Roommate.-Finder.git
cd Campus-Roommate.-Finder  # or campus_roommate_finder depending on folder name
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Configure Supabase

Create a config file (for example `lib/config/supabase_config.dart`) and ensure it is imported where Supabase is initialized:

```dart
class SupabaseConfig {
  static const String url = '<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>';
  static const String anonKey = '<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>';
}
```

Do **not** commit real keys to a public repo.

### 5. Database & Storage

- Run the provided SQL migrations (users/messages/favorites/listings, RLS, storage) in the Supabase SQL editor.
- Ensure storage buckets for **profile photos** and **listings** are created and policies applied.

> See `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` for more detail on schema and policies.

### 6. Run the App (Debug)

```bash
flutter run
```

Choose a device (Android / iOS simulator or physical device).

## 📦 Building a Release APK (Android)

From the project root:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Output:

```text
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

You can then:
- Copy the APK to a device (USB, AirDrop, cloud).
- Enable installation from unknown sources on the device.
- Install and test.

For more detail, see `APK_DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md`.

## 🧪 High-Level Architecture

- **Screens (UI)** – Flutter widgets for onboarding, match feed, filters, chat, marketplace, profile, etc.
- **Providers (Riverpod)** – Expose app state and async data to the UI.
- **Services** – Encapsulate business logic and Supabase operations:
  - `DatabaseService` – users, messages, favorites
  - `MatchingService` – compatibility scoring and ranked matches
  - `ListingService` – marketplace CRUD & photo upload
  - `NotificationService` – local notifications & realtime listeners

Data flows roughly as:

```text
UI (Screens)
  ↓
State (Riverpod Providers)
  ↓
Services (business logic)
  ↓
Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage, Realtime)
```

More detail is available in `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) used on core tables.  
- Users can only access their own sensitive data and conversations.  
- Storage policies restrict who can upload/delete images.

If making the project public, ensure:
- No secrets (Supabase keys, etc.) are committed.  
- You provide a basic privacy policy if sharing with real users.
